6. **HR Management Interface**

   - HR can view employee data, verify employee status, and make salary payments. They can also filter work records by employee name or month/year.

7. **Admin Dashboard**

   - Admin can manage all employees, make employees HRs, and fire employees. Admin has full access to view employee details, approve payments, and adjust salaries.

8. **Employee Details & Progress Tracking**

   - HR can view employee profiles, including personal info, photo, and work records. A bar chart shows salary vs. month/year for each employee.

   - All operations (add, edit, delete) are handled via forms and tables, with sweet alert/toast notifications for success or failure feedback.

10. **Role-specific Route Protection**
    - The app uses JWT tokens for secure authentication, ensuring that only users with the correct role (Employee, HR, Admin) can access their respective routes and functionalities.
11. **Payment Gateway Integration**
    - Admin can make salary payments to employees via a payment gateway(stripe). Payments can only be made once per month/year to avoid double payments.
